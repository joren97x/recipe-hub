True story. As I walked inside sports complex, 37 women rushed to me and pulled their pants off tryna flash me their Coochie. I replied sternly “Haram”. All 37 women were so shook all their clothes came off in a swift attack caused my aura. My friend who watches Jujutsu Kaisen did not accept this tomfoolery and unsheathed his domain "Domain Expansion: Malevolent Kitchen" and cut them into pieces causing a crimson rainfall reminiscent of your mother's period once a month(mura ug sukuna ba). Dare I say, it was a bloody good day.
